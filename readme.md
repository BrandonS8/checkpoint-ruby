## Pro Tip: Test Your Code

You should first test your code's functionality in the terminal.

Once you think your code is correct, you can run the tests that will evaluate your solutions to double-check them.

To do so, first install the testing gems from the Gemfile:
```
bundle install
```
Then call the test runner each time you want to check your code:
```
bundle exec rspec --format documentation
```
> IMPORTANT: To allow the tests to run without interruption, comment out any `binding.pry` statements in your code each time before calling the test runner
